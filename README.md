# Rebbit

This project was made with Angular and noSQL db json-server.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `json-server --watch db.json` in order to watch db.json file. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to look for a data in noSQL db.
